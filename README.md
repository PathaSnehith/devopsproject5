# TalentFlow – Mini Hiring Platform

TalentFlow is a small React app I built to practice common HR workflows without a backend. It manages jobs, candidates, and quick assessments, and stores everything locally (IndexedDB) so a refresh doesn’t wipe your work.

## 🚀 Live Application

**Deployed App:** [Live on Netlify](https://hiringplatform123.netlify.app)  
**GitHub Repository:** [PathaSnehith/Talentflow](https://github.com/PathaSnehith/Talentflow)

## ✨ What it does

### 1. Jobs Management ✅
- Create, edit, archive, and reorder jobs with drag-and-drop
- Server-like pagination and filtering (title, status, tags)
- Deep linking to individual job pages (`/jobs/:jobId`)
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Beautiful job cards with hover effects
- Job validation (title required, unique slug)
- Archive/unarchive functionality
- Real-time search and filtering

### 2. Candidates Management ✅
- Virtualized list for 1000+ candidates
- Client-side search by name/email
- Stage filtering (applied, screen, tech, offer, hired, rejected)
- Kanban board view with drag-and-drop
- Candidate profile pages (`/candidates/:id`)
- Timeline of status changes
- Notes with @mentions support
- Move candidates between stages dynamically
- View candidate details and history

### 3. Assessments ✅
- Assessment builder per job
- Multiple question types:
  - Single-choice questions
  - Multi-choice questions
  - Short text
  - Long text
  - Numeric with range validation
  - File upload stub
- Live preview pane that updates in real-time
- Conditional questions (show based on previous answers)
- Persist builder state locally
- Add sections and questions dynamically
- Form validation (required, numeric range, max length)

### 4. Dashboard ✅
- Real-time statistics and metrics
- Candidate pipeline visualization
- Recent activity feed
- Quick action buttons
- Hiring rate calculation
- Beautiful data visualization

```

### State management
- **Zustand stores** for jobs, candidates, and assessments
- **Persistent storage** using Zustand's persist middleware
- **Local-first** approach with IndexedDB backup
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Automatic rollback** on failures

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger store actions
2. Store updates UI optimistically
3. Changes persisted to IndexedDB
4. On refresh, state restored from IndexedDB
5. No external API dependency

### Design system
- **Natural Color Palette:** Sage, moss, stone, and earth tones
- **Typography:** Inter (body), Crimson Text (headings), JetBrains Mono (code)
- **Components:** Reusable cards, buttons, inputs with consistent styling
- **Animations:** Fade, slide, and scale transitions
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PathaSnehith/Talentflow.git
   cd talentflow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build/` directory with optimized production files.

### Docker Workflow

1. **Build the image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t talentflow:latest .
   ```
2. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -p 8080:80 talentflow:latest
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8080` to access the SPA served by Nginx. The Docker image uses a multi-stage build so that the final layer only contains the static assets plus the lightweight Nginx runtime.

### Jenkins CI/CD

This repo includes a declarative `Jenkinsfile` that:

1. Checks out the repo, runs `npm ci`, executes the React tests in CI mode, and builds the production bundle.
2. Builds a Docker image with the same steps as the local Dockerfile.
3. Optionally pushes the image when `PUSH_IMAGE=true` (default) using the `dockerhub-creds` Jenkins credential.
4. Optionally triggers a deployment hook when `AUTO_DEPLOY=true` (replace the placeholder command with your real deploy script).

**Jenkins prerequisites**
- Linux agent with Node.js 18+, npm, and Docker CLI access.
- Jenkins credential `dockerhub-creds` (username + password/token).
- Parameter `IMAGE_NAME` set to your Docker registry repository (e.g., `your-user/talentflow`).
- Deployment script/command available to the agent if you enable the Deploy stage.

### Netlify deployment

1. Connect repo: New Site → Import from Git → choose `PathaSnehith/Talentflow`.
2. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
   - Environment variables:
     - `NODE_VERSION=18`
     - `CI=false`
3. SPA redirects: ensure `public/_redirects` contains `/* /index.html 200`.
4. Deploy and copy the site URL. Add it to `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## 📊 Seed data

The application comes pre-loaded with:
- **25 Jobs** (mixed active/archived with various tags)
- **1,000 Candidates** randomly assigned to jobs and stages
- **3 Assessments** with 10+ questions each

All data persists in browser's IndexedDB and survives page refreshes.

## 🔧 Technical decisions (short version)

**React (JavaScript)**
- Matches the assignment (React without TypeScript)
- Simple setup for a front‑end–only demo
- Big ecosystem and community

**Zustand**
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- Built-in persistence
- Simple API for complex state management
- Better performance than Context API

**IndexedDB via Dexie**
- No backend required for demo
- Offline-first architecture
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Persistent across sessions

**Tailwind CSS**
- Rapid UI development
- Consistent design system
- Custom natural theme
- Easy to maintain and customize

**@dnd-kit**
- Modern, accessible drag-and-drop library
- Better than react-beautiful-dnd
- Supports keyboard navigation
- Optimistic updates out of the box

### Performance notes
- **Virtualization** for large lists (1000+ candidates)
- **Memoization** for expensive calculations
- **Optimistic updates** for instant feedback
- **Lazy loading** for route components
- **Code splitting** for smaller bundles

## ⚠️ Notes & trade‑offs

### 1. MSW Integration
**Issue:** Need a network layer with latency/errors but no backend.  
**Solution:** MSW enabled in development (`App.jsx`) with 200–1200ms delay and ~8% error on writes; data writes through to Dexie.

### 2. Candidate Drag-and-Drop in Kanban
**Issue:** Stage transitions should be intuitive.  
**Solution:** Implemented drag-and-drop between columns; updates persist to Dexie and Zustand.

### 3. Conditional Questions Preview
**Issue:** Conditional questions need runtime evaluation.  
**Solution:** Builder supports conditional logic configuration. Full runtime evaluation can be implemented.

### 4. File Upload
**Issue:** File upload is stubbed.  
**Solution:** Basic structure exists. Real file handling can be added.
